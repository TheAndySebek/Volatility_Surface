# Volatility_Surface
Visualizing Volatility in a variety of ways!

I used Yahoo Finance data to plot the volatility smile, surface, and term in a Jupyter notebook. In the (ideally, near) future, I will implement this into Visual Studio code. I tried doing it earlier, but realized that this is a great opportunity to practice making a user interface! Still, that will be time ineffective for my present goals, so I will need to come back to it later. I think it would be cool to have a sliding scale input for the vol_term() function so that one can visualize the change in the term volatility as the strike price changes. 

Likewise, since the Expiry column has really ugly entries, I'd prefer to have a dropdown input for the vol_smile() function so that it is more usable.

Regardless, if you're a recruiter, you should talk with me about this during our interview :p! Better yet, just hire me, and we can talk about it on lunch break lol (I need a job)
